# Contributing Guidelines

1. Create a new branch for every feature or bug fix (e.g., `feature/ui`, `fix/typo`).
2. Write clear and meaningful commit messages.
3. Follow simple and clean Python code style (PEP 8 recommended).
4. Test changes locally before committing.
5. Do not push directly to the main branch; use pull requests.
6. Keep files organised inside the `src/` and `docs/` folders.
7. Ask questions through GitHub Issues if unsure.
